# Folding Instructions for the BadgESC{21} Badge

These are the instructions for folding the **BadgESC{21} Badge** into its final cube shape.
Use a **plastic card** or another thin, flat object to achieve tight bends on the PET plastic substrate. It may also be possible to mold the shape by gently warming the material, although this method has not been tested.

To secure the folded parts, use **UV glue**, **superglue**, or another strong adhesive.

## Step 1: Initial Positioning

1. Place the badge on a flat surface with the components **facing up**.
2. Bend the **USB connector flap** by aligning its edge with the **solid white line** located near the set of **small resistors**, **not** the large ones.
3. The large resistors are not connected to any circuit. They are present only to provide structural thickness for engaging the USB Type-C connectorâ€™s locking mechanism.

## Step 2: Power Switch and Battery Test

1. Ensure the **power slide switch** lever is positioned **outside the white silkscreen**, which indicates the badge is powered **off**.
2. Insert the battery and briefly **test the badge** by toggling the power switch.

1. **Remove the battery** before proceeding.
2. Begin folding the badge along the **solid silkscreen lines** using a **flat, thin piece of plastic** to help create sharp bends.

## Step 4: Folding the Top

Continue folding the upper section of the badge carefully, ensuring all edges align properly.

## Step 5: Gluing the Structure

This is the most delicate part of the assembly.
Apply **small drops of glue** to the sides while maintaining the cube shape. You can use your **fingers** or **tape** to hold the parts in place while the glue sets.

## Step 6: Final Assembly

After the glue cures, the badge should form a stable cube-like structure as shown above.

Your **BadgESC{21} Badge** is now ready for use.
