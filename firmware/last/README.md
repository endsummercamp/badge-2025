### 1.1 Connect to Access Point (AP)

Since the firmware does not yet have your Wi-Fi credentials, the badge will create its own access point (AP).
Connect to it using the following information:

* **SSID:** `WLED-AP`
* **Password:** `wled1234`

## 2. Upload Configuration

Once connected to the device, find its IP address and navigate there.


1. At the top of the page, click **Config** â†’ **Security & Updates**.
2. Scroll down until you reach **Backup & Restore** and **Restore presets**.

     *(Be sure to press **Upload** after selecting the file.)*
4. Next, in the **Restore configuration** section, select and upload the file:
