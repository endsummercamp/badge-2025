The badge has been designed by (Jacopo Franco)[https://www.jacopofranco.com/], that we thank for the effort in making this literal show of force a reality ;)

Special thanks to (Kezi)[https://github.com/Kezii], (Kowalski)[https://github.com/kowalski7cc] & (Baobots)[https://github.com/baobots] for the efforts spent into debugging & flashing all of them during the camp.
